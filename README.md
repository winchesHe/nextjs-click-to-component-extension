## Requirements

- Installed [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
- Works only with development builds.
- Source code must be stored on local disk

## How it works

The React Inspector accesses the `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` set globally by the React Devtools and finds the [React Fiber](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html#what-is-react-fiber) in the HTML element that the inspector hovered over.
The React Fiber contains information about the source code that will be added during development, so we use that information to open the VSCode.
